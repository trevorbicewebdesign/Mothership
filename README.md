## Clients
The Clients module is the core of Mothership's client management system. It enables web development agencies to maintain detailed records of their clients, ensuring seamless invoicing, project tracking, and communication.

#### Key Features
Client Profiles:
Store and manage essential client information, including business name, contact details, and address.

#### Joomla Integration:
Each client record is associated with a Joomla user (owner) and includes standard Joomla fields for record management, such as created_by, checked_out, and checked_out_time.

#### Financial Information:
Keep track of important billing details like tax IDs and default hourly rates for streamlined invoicing and project costing.

#### Status Management:
Easily mark clients as active or inactive, helping you manage clients without permanently deleting historical data.

#### Custom Notes:
A flexible "notes" field allows you to record any additional details or specific instructions related to the client.
