## Clients
The Clients module is the core of Mothership's client management system. It enables web development agencies to maintain detailed records of their clients, ensuring seamless invoicing, project tracking, and communication.

#### Key Features
Client Profiles:
Store and manage essential client information, including business name, contact details, and address.

#### Joomla Integration:
Each client record is associated with a Joomla user (owner) and includes standard Joomla fields for record management, such as created_by, checked_out, and checked_out_time.

#### Financial Information:
Keep track of important billing details like tax IDs and default hourly rates for streamlined invoicing and project costing.

#### Custom Notes:
A flexible "notes" field allows you to record any additional details or specific instructions related to the client.

## Accounts
The Accounts module in Mothership serves as the financial backbone for managing client billing and project funds. Designed to help agencies organize and track multiple income sources, Accounts represent distinct financial entities tied to clients, such as retainers, prepaid hours, or specific project budgets.

### Key Features
Account Management:
Easily create and manage multiple accounts for each client, allowing you to separate different funding sources, projects, or service agreements.

### Client Association:
Every account is directly linked to a client, ensuring accurate and organized billing, reporting, and project tracking.
